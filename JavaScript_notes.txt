>>  Types of datatype
 I. Primitive datatype
   1. number 
   2. bigint //used for larger number
   3. string=""
   4. Boolean = true/false
   5. null = standalone value and also a datatype
   6. undefined
   7. Symbol = used to find uniqueness 

II. Reference/ non-primitive type 
 1. Array
 2. Objects
 3. Functions


>> MEMORY :
Two types of memory in JS
1. Stack memory (--primitive data types come under stack memory -- In Stack memory always share the copy of the variable)
2. Heap memory (--Non-primitive data comes under heap memory --it takes the reference of the variable i.e. Original value)


>> String Interpolation in JavaScript :
String interpolation is a great programming language feature that allows injecting variables, function calls, and arithmetic expressions directly into a string.


>> Precision
const num2 = 76.32423
console.log(num2.toPrecision(4))  // Precision takes one argument as a number which focuses that particular digits 

>> Math 
 - console.log(Math) // Object [Math] {}
 - Math is an object 
 - Math.random() --> it will display values from 0-1 (ex : 0.653, 0.253, 0.098, 0.123)


 >> Date : Date is an object in JavaScript
   let mydate = new Date()
  console.log(mydate) //2023-08-31T14:32:39.672Z
  console.log(mydate.toDateString()) //Thu Aug 31 2023
  console.log(mydate.toISOString())  //2023-08-31T14:34:22.492Z
  //console.log(mydate.toJSON())
  console.log(mydate.toLocaleDateString())   //8/31/2023


  >> Arrays :
   so JavaScript arrays will contain all the types of data in a single array 
   ex:  const arr = new Array(1,2,3,"Neha", "%")
        console.log(arr)  //[ 1, 2, 3, 'Neha', '%' ]

   #. slice and splice operations
    1. Slice : taking 2 arguments as the starting index and last index and it does not contain the last index values i.e. its end before that index
       ex : Before the slice operation array = 1,2,3,Neha,%
          console.log(arr1.slice(1,4))  //[ 2, 3, 'Neha' ]
          After Slice operation array = 1,2,3,Neha,%

    2. Splice: takes 2 arguments as starting and end index. also, it deletes that particular index range values and also reflects the original value.
      ex : Before the splice operation array = 9,8,7,6,5,4,3
            console.log(arr2.splice(2, 5))  // [ 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 ]
          After Splice operation array = 9,8

    3. push() : insertion from front
    4. pop() : deletion from last
  **5. concat : combined two arrays and returned one array 
  **6. Spread : similar to concat, which combines 2 arrays into a single array ...arr1, ...arr2
    7. Flat :  convert multiple values into a single array

    >> Object
    we can create objects in two ways either using 1. Singleton and 2. Literals
    1. Singleton: while creating an object through Singleton only one object will be created and we also called as constructor

    2. Literals: with the help of literals will create multiple instances of the object

    **** How to merge multiple object in JS ?
    -EX : Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2)
    - {} : here empty "{}" is a targeting array where all the values are stored 
    - In the  above example, object. Assign is used to merge multiple objects into a single object
    - And Object. assign also return one object so a new object is required to store the after-merging data.

    // function calculationCard(...num) {      //rest operator for dynamic data handling 
    //     return num
    // }

>> SCOPE of variables : {} is called scope
 We have three types of variables :
 1. const : 
 2. let
 3. var : not recommended to use due to its scope, var value gets changed after the local scope
