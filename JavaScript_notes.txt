>>  Types of datatype
 I. Primitive datatype
   1.number 
   2. bigint //used for larger number
   3. string=""
   4. boolen = true/false
   5. null = standalone value and aslo a datatype
   6. undefined
   7. symbole = used to find uniqneness 

II. Reference/ non-primitive type 
 1. Array
 2. Objects
 3. Functions


>> MEMORY :
Two types of memory in JS
1. stack memory (--primitive data types comes under stack memoery -- In Stack memory always share the copy of the variable)
2. Heap memory (--Non-primitive data comes under heap memory --ist takes the refernece of the varibale i.e. Original value)


>> String Interpolation in JavaScript :
String interpolation is a great programming language feature that allows injecting variables, function calls, arithmetic expressions directly into a string.


>> Precision
const num2 = 76.32423
console.log(num2.toPrecision(4))  // Precision taking one arugment as number which focus that particular digits 

>> Math 
 - console.log(Math) // Object [Math] {}
 - Math is a object 
 - Math.random() --> it will display values from 0-1 (ex : 0.653, 0.253, 0.098, 0.123)


 >> Date : Date is a object in JavaScript
   let mydate = new Date()
  console.log(mydate) //2023-08-31T14:32:39.672Z
  console.log(mydate.toDateString()) //Thu Aug 31 2023
  console.log(mydate.toISOString())  //2023-08-31T14:34:22.492Z
  //console.log(mydate.toJSON())
  console.log(mydate.toLocaleDateString())   //8/31/2023


  >> Arrays :
   so javascript arrays will contain all the type of data in a single array 
   ex:  const arr = new Array(1,2,3,"Neha", "%")
        console.log(arr)  //[ 1, 2, 3, 'Neha', '%' ]

  *** Interviwe
   #. slice and splice operations
    1. Slice : taking 2 arugment as starting index and last index and it does not contain the last index values i.e. its end before that index
       ex : Before the slice operation array = 1,2,3,Neha,%
          console.log(arr1.slice(1,4))  //[ 2, 3, 'Neha' ]
          After Slice operation array = 1,2,3,Neha,%

    2. Splice : takes 2 arugment as starting and end index. also it deletes that particular index range values and alos reflected to the original value.
      ex : Before the splice operatio array = 9,8,7,6,5,4,3
            console.log(arr2.splice(2, 5))  // [ 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 ]
          After Splice operation array = 9,8

    3. push() : insertion from front
    4. pop() : deletion from last
  **5. concat : combined two arrays and returned one array 
  **6. Spread : asimailr to concat, which combines 2 arrays into single array ...arr1, ...arr2
    7. Flat :  convert multple values into a single array

    >> Object
    we can create objects in two ways either using 1. Singleton and 2. Literals
    1. Signleton : while creating objcet through Singleton then only one object will be created and we also called as constructor

    2. Literals : with the help of literals will create multiple instances of the object

    **** How to merge mltiple object in JS ?
    -EX : Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2)
    - {} : here empty "{}" is targating array where all the values are stored 
    - In the  above example, object.assign is used to merge multile objects into a single object
    - And Object.assign also return one object so new object is required to store the after merging data.
